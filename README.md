 Question 1:
 
>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is >23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```
import Foundation
var sum = 0
for index in 1..<1000{
    if index % 3 == 0 || index % 5 == 0 {
        sum += index
    }
}
print(sum)
```

Question 2:
>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 >terms will be:
>
>>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued >terms.
